# Offensive Efficiency in the NFL
# TEST TEXT FROM CLONED REPO
In the National Football League, coaches employ a variety of guiding philosophies that they believe are superior, proven pathways to consistent success. These days, much attention has been directed at the explosive offenses of the Los Angeles Rams and the Kansas City Chiefs, two teams who score very quickly while also surrendering a lot of points on defense. Some pundits and NFL veterans argue that this is the future of the league.

However, one approach that is getting overlooked is the maximization of "offensive efficiency." For this analysis, we'll define "offensive efficiency" as:

> <i>"Scoring the most points possible while prolonging possession of the ball in order to limit the opponent's possession of the ball."</i>

Teams that are highly offensive efficient therefore demonstrate the following traits:

- More plays per drive
- More yards per drive
- Longer time of possession
- And obviously, more points per drive

Unlike the Rams and Chiefs, who often score touchdowns on a few large-yardage plays per drive, the 2018 New Orleans Saints rarely registered explosive plays that resulted in 40+ yards gained. Most of their plays were for short and intermediate yard gains that sustained drives that ultimately ended in a score. We'll explore how these metrics of offensive efficiency differ among good teams (12+ regular season wins), OK teams (7 to 11 wins), and bad teams (<7 wins), and whether any trends have emerged over time.
